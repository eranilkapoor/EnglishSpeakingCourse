## **2. Common Myths & Fears about Speaking English**

Many learners in India hesitate to speak English because of **myths** and **fears**. Let’s address them:

### 🔹 **Common Myths**

1. **“I need perfect grammar before I can speak.”**
   ❌ Wrong. Children learn to *speak first, then grammar later*. You can start speaking with basic grammar.

2. **“Only convent school students can speak English.”**
   ❌ Wrong. Anyone can learn with practice—many fluent speakers never studied in English-medium schools.

3. **“My accent should be like British or American speakers.”**
   ❌ Wrong. Neutral, clear English is enough. Accent is not as important as clarity.

4. **“I am too old to learn English.”**
   ❌ Wrong. Language learning is possible at any age with daily practice.

### 🔹 **Common Fears**

1. **Fear of Making Mistakes** → “What if people laugh at me?”
   👉 Everyone makes mistakes; mistakes are stepping stones.

2. **Fear of Being Judged** → Worrying about others’ opinions.
   👉 Most people actually admire learners who try to speak.

3. **Fear of Forgetting Words Mid-Sentence** →
   👉 Use simple words. If you forget, replace with an easy alternative.

4. **Fear of Speaking in Public** → Stage fright or hesitation.
   👉 Start small: speak with friends, then small groups, then larger audiences.

👉 **Summary:** Don’t wait for perfection—start speaking with what you know. Confidence grows with practice.

👉 **Summary:** Break your learning into small achievable steps. Celebrate small wins to stay motivated.
