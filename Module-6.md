# 📘 Module 6 – Speaking Practice (Daily Conversations & Role Plays)

This is the **heart of learning English** – because the main goal is to **speak confidently in real life**.
Many learners know grammar but hesitate to speak. This module removes fear through **daily practice & role plays**.

---

## **1. Overcoming Fear of Speaking**

* **Think in English** → Don’t translate from Hindi/other language.
* **Start Small** → Short sentences → “I am hungry.” “Let’s go.”
* **Don’t Aim for Perfection** → Fluency > Grammar.
* **Practice Alone First** → Talk to yourself, mirror practice.

👉 Remember: Even native speakers make mistakes!

---

## **2. Daily Conversation Practice**

These are the most common **everyday situations** where English is needed:

### 🔹 Greetings & Introductions

* “Hello, how are you?”
* “Nice to meet you. My name is…”

### 🔹 Asking & Giving Information

* “Where is the nearest bus stop?”
* “The office is on the second floor.”

### 🔹 Shopping

* “How much does this cost?”
* “Do you accept cards?”

### 🔹 Ordering Food

* “Can I get a cup of coffee, please?”
* “I’d like a vegetarian sandwich.”

### 🔹 Telephone Conversations

* “Hello, may I speak to Mr. Sharma?”
* “Sorry, wrong number.”

### 🔹 Daily Routines

* Talking about your day → “I wake up at 7, then I go to the office.”

👉 Each topic should be **practiced with 5–6 sample sentences daily**.

---

## **3. Role Play Activities**

Role play = **acting real-life situations**.
This helps in job interviews, travel, customer service, and social life.

### 🔹 Example Role Plays

* **At the Restaurant** → One student is waiter, another is customer.
* **At the Airport** → One is passenger, another is officer.
* **At the Office** → One is boss, another is employee.
* **At the Shop** → One is customer, another is shopkeeper.

👉 Role play improves **confidence + vocabulary + fluency** together.

## **4. Speaking Techniques to Improve Fluency**

* **Shadowing Method** → Listen to a sentence → immediately repeat aloud.
* **Mirror Practice** → Speak in front of a mirror → observe facial expressions.
* **Question-Answer Game** → Partner asks random questions → answer quickly.
* **Storytelling** → Pick a picture or memory → explain in English.

---

## **5. Vocabulary for Daily Speaking**

Learners often stop mid-sentence because they **don’t know the right word**.
So, build vocabulary for:

* Greetings (Hi, Hello, Good morning…)
* Polite words (Please, Sorry, Thank you, Excuse me…)
* Connectors (Actually, By the way, You know, So…)
* Daily activities (eat, work, study, travel, buy, call…)

👉 Tip: Write **5 new words daily**, and use them in your sentences.

---

## **6. Grammar for Speaking (Practical Only)**

Don’t overload with rules – focus on **what is needed to talk**:

* **Present tense** → “I go to office.”
* **Past tense** → “I went to office.”
* **Future tense** → “I will go to office.”
* **Questions** → “Do you like tea?” / “Where are you going?”
* **Polite forms** → “Could you help me?”
