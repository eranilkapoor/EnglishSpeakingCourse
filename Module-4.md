# 📘 Module 4 – Pronunciation & Accent Training (Detailed Explanation)

---

## **1. Correct Pronunciation of Commonly Misused Words**

In India, many English words are pronounced differently than globally. Fixing them builds confidence.

### 🔹 Common Mistakes

* **Vegetable** → ❌ *vege-table* → ✅ *vej-ta-bl*
* **Wednesday** → ❌ *wed-nes-day* → ✅ *wenz-day*
* **Breakfast** → ❌ *break-fast* → ✅ *brek-fst*
* **School** → ❌ *iskool* → ✅ *skool*
* **Receipt** → ❌ *re-seep-t* → ✅ *ri-seet*

👉 **Practice Tip:** Make a list of 20 tricky words → say them daily.

## **2. Sounds of English (Phonetics Basics)**

English has **44 sounds (phonemes)**, but Indian languages don’t always match them.

### 🔹 Vowel Sounds

* Short: /i/ (*sit*), /e/ (*pen*), /a/ (*cat*), /o/ (*dog*), /u/ (*cup*)
* Long: /iː/ (*see*), /uː/ (*food*), /ɑː/ (*car*), /ɔː/ (*ball*)

### 🔹 Consonant Sounds

* /θ/ (*think*), /ð/ (*this*) → often tough for Indian learners.
* /v/ vs. /w/ → *very* ≠ *wary*.

👉 **Practice Tip:** Use YouTube phonetics videos & repeat sounds daily.

---

## **3. Stress & Intonation Patterns**

How you **stress** words & sentences changes meaning.

### 🔹 Word Stress

* *TAble*, *COMputer*, *DEVelop*.
  (Always stress on one syllable in longer words.)

### 🔹 Sentence Stress

* *I want a cup of **TEA*** (not coffee).
* *I **WANT** a cup of tea* (emphasis on want).

### 🔹 Intonation (Rising/Falling Tone)

* Questions → Rising tone: *Are you coming?* ↗
* Statements → Falling tone: *I am coming.* ↘
* Yes/No questions → Rising: *Is he there?* ↗

👉 **Practice Tip:** Record yourself reading sentences with different stress.

## **4. Accent Neutralization (Indian to Global English)**

Accent isn’t about copying British or American—it’s about **speaking clearly** so anyone can understand.

### 🔹 Key Tips

* Avoid adding extra vowels → ❌ *iskool* → ✅ *school*.
* Don’t roll “r” too strongly → *car* (not *carr*).
* Avoid mother tongue influence (MTI) → like pronouncing “v” as “w”.
* Speak **slow & clear** instead of fast & unclear.

👉 **Practice Tip:** Listen to international speakers (TED Talks, BBC News) and mimic them.

## **5. Tongue Twisters & Practice Drills**

Tongue twisters help train your mouth muscles for clarity & fluency.

### 🔹 Examples

* *She sells seashells by the seashore.*
* *Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.*
* *Red lorry, yellow lorry.*

👉 **Daily Drill Routine**

1. Warm-up → Say A–Z slowly, stressing each letter.
2. Speak 2 tongue twisters (3 times each).
3. Read a short English news paragraph aloud.
4. Record & compare with native pronunciation.

* **5 mins** → Practice vowel & consonant sounds.
* **5 mins** → Read aloud with stress/intonation.
