## **4. Listening Practice Strategies**

### (a) Start Small

* Begin with **short clips (1–2 mins)** → then move to longer content.
* Choose **clear English speakers** first (news, audiobooks).

### (b) Use Subtitles

* Instead of every word, catch **nouns, verbs, adjectives**.
  Example:

  * Keywords: *grab – bite – heading out* → meaning = “eat quickly before leaving.”

### (e) Exposure to Accents

* British: BBC News, Sherlock, Harry Potter.
