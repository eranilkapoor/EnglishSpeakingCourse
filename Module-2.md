## **1. Nouns, Pronouns, and Articles**

### 🔹 Nouns

* Nouns are **naming words** (person, place, thing, idea).
* **Types**:

  * Common (dog, city, book)
  * Proper (Delhi, Microsoft, Ganga)
  * Countable (apple/apples) vs. Uncountable (milk, sugar)
  * Abstract (love, honesty)

👉 Example: *Ravi is reading a book in Delhi.*

### 🔹 Pronouns

* Words that **replace nouns** to avoid repetition.
* Examples: I, you, he, she, it, we, they, mine, yours.

👉 Example: *Ravi is my friend. He lives in Delhi. I like him.*

### 🔹 Articles

* **a, an, the**

  * “a” → before consonant sound (*a dog, a book*)
  * “an” → before vowel sound (*an apple, an umbrella*)
  * “the” → for something specific (*the moon, the Taj Mahal*)

👉 Example: *I saw a dog. The dog was barking.*

## **2. Verbs, Tenses, and Conjugations**

### 🔹 Verbs

* Action words (run, eat, play, go).
* Also describe states (is, am, are, have).

### 🔹 Tenses

Tenses show **time** of action.

* **Present** → *I eat mangoes.*
* **Past** → *I ate mangoes.*
* **Future** → *I will eat mangoes.*

Each has **4 forms** (Simple, Continuous, Perfect, Perfect Continuous).
👉 Example (Present tense):

* Simple → *I play cricket.*
* Continuous → *I am playing cricket.*
* Perfect → *I have played cricket.*
